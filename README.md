# Countries

It is the code test that adesso sent. I tried to follow the given example completely.
CoreData is used for the data managment. The api key was specifically left inside the project.
To make it easier to test.

# Installation
Both SPM and CacaoPods were used in the project.
Just install pods and enjoy my api key.🤣

- Kingfisher and SVGKit were used to render the incoming image for the flag.
- Used Alamofire for APICalls.

## General rules
- Third party libraries are allowed. (CocoaPods, SPM or Carthage) ✅
- You can use SwiftUI but UIKit knowledge is a must. ✅
- You need to upload the project to your github page. ✅
- You have 5 days to deliver us the project after getting this document. ✅
- Project name should be “Countries” ✅
- Project is expected to be implemented with XCode 13. ✅

## Nice to haves
- Unit tests are optional but you can get extra points. 😇
- It would be good to have a README file. Having any documentation is awesome! ☺. ✅
